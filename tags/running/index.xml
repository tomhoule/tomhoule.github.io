      <description>This is a race report, probably most interesting for myself looking back on it later, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s writing practice.&#xA;The race Yesterday, I ran my first half marathon in Potsdam. It was a sunny day, around 20°C. I have done the distance in long runs before, so I knew I could finish if I didn&amp;rsquo;t go out too fast. The A goal was finishing under 2 hours, and the B goal was finishing with an even or nearly even split, not slowing down too much towards the end.</description>
