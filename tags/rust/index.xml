      <description>I had free time yesterday,so I continued my efforts to find a better creative coding setup. What came out of it is the tomhoule/wgpu-minimal-video-rendering-example GitHub repo.&#xA;I like how working on this feels: with mold, iteration time is pretty fast (recompilation + rendering and enconding in a &amp;lt; 5 seconds on my old laptop), and the artifacts are easy to share. It feels solid.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this, just have a look at the repo.</description>

      <description>Historically, there have been a number of approaches to the problem of building Rust projects with Nix1. The most common one these days is buildRustPackage. It integrates reasonably well with cargo and supports cross-compilation out of the box, but if you want to build a project targetting wasm32-unknown-unknown, you will not find much help online.&#xA;Since I recently had to figure that out for prisma-fmt-wasm, this will be a short post walking through a setup that works.</description>
