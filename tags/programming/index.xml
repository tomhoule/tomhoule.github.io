      <description>Since ChatGPT is the trend of the moment, I had to check it out. There is a lot to say about it in general, but that won&amp;rsquo;t be the focus of this post.&#xA;Recently at work, a colleague asked how he could observe what files a process accesses, without modifying the program. Tracing tools like strace are the best answer I know to that question, and they apply to a lot more than observing file system access.</description>
