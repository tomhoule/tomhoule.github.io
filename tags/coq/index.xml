      <description>I just finished Logical Foundations, the first part of the Software Foundations series. Since last time on this blog, I also completed chapter 2 of Calculus, with the exercises (most of them) done in Lean 3.&#xA;This post is a loose collection of impressions and learnings from a few more months spent working with theorem provers on my spare time.&#xA;Logical Foundations First, Logical Foundations is just great. I picked it up to learn Coq mainly, and as the natural path to the exciting Programming Language Foundations.</description>
